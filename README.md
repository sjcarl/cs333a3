This is an interactive visualization made for my CS 333 class at Northwestern. 

I present it as a case-study for how a business analyst might use demographic and transactional data 
to answer targeted questions, rather than as a representation of broader consumer behavior. 

Questions include, 
(1) Which demographic groups generate the highest revenue? 
(2) How do product preferences vary by age or gender? 
(3) Which categories contribute most to sales?
